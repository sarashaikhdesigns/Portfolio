        Polaris (the North Star) has been used as a guide in navigation and a symbol in folklore. Its meaning and presence inspired me to create this art piece merging historical use with modern aesthetics. I used cyanotype printing, a sun dying process for the creation of blueprints, on a 24×36 board. The theme of navigation is integrated throughout the piece, with use of asterisks, symbolism within drawings, and overlays of annotations.

        This is a dynamic campaign addressing period poverty through a set of three posters and a captivating short film. Using a pink and red palette and a mix of feminine and aggressive typography, it grabs attention and demands action. The posters use a combination of painting techniques, and visually express the multifaceted issue, telling a compelling story of its impact. This project isn't just about awareness; it's a call to dismantle the stigma, advocate for change, and urge viewers to react and join the movement for menstrual equity.

        <p>BellePeur is a fiction skincare company for which I created both the branding and an app. It functions as a premium brand, offering customers the convenience of shopping for its products through the app. In viewing order, I made a loading page, a product page, a menu bar, a home page, an about us page, and a sign up page. </p>

          I coded this website from using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to teach young designers about the importance of shape in art. They can explore my website to get a better understanding on the history and uses of different geometric shapes. Each shape has its own page which covers a brief history, its mathematical functions, and a famous artist that uses that shape.
